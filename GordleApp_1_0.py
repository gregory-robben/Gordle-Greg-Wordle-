"""
Gordle is a python clone of the popular 'Wordle' game, now owned by the NYT. 
Rules of the base game:
    Guess the GORDLE in 6 tries.

    Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.

    After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

    Green = Correct letter and location, Yellow = Correct letter wrong location, Grey = Letter not in word

In Gordle the user can choose harder modes which make the Gordle longer. The number of tries goes up accordingly

TODO: figure out how to print the board and print over it each time.
      - Could fill in the game board dictionary and reprint each time
      - Could not print the whole thing and just print as you go.
#TODO: Proper logging
